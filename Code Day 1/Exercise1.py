# Exercise 1

# I have a very large triangle with a base of 145.3 meters, and a height
# of 34.7 meters.

# Write a short program to compute the area of this triangle!


###### Hint 1 #####
# Remember that the formula for a triangle's area is
# area = base*height
#        -----------
#            2
#
# You might want to start by creating a variable for 'base' and a
# variable called 'height', and then using operators to
# compute another variable for area, using the base and height.

##### Hint 2 #####
# If you have a variable, you can use the 'print'
# function to display it to the screen.

# x = 123
# print(x)    # "123" will be displayed on the screen
